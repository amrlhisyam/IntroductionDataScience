# Daily Public Transport Ridership Predictions Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Public transportation is a key component in the urban ecosystem of Malaysia, particularly in the Klang Valley. Efficient transit systems are crucial to ensuring mobility, reducing congestion, and supporting sustainable city development. This project leverages machine learning to analyze historical ridership data and build predictive models for daily public transport usage.

The aim is to support transportation authorities in making data-driven operational decisions that result in more efficient and reliable public transport services.

## ❓ Problem Statement

- Daily ridership can vary significantly, posing a challenge for agencies relying on static scheduling.
- Many transportation agencies possess ridership data but lack automated forecasting systems.
- This results in service inefficiencies such as under-serving during peak hours or resource wastage during low demand.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and clean historical public transport ridership data from Malaysia’s urban systems.
- Build a machine learning model to predict daily ridership based on historical patterns.
- Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, reliability, and practical relevance for real-world transit planning.

## 💡 Motivation

Transportation systems must evolve to meet changing urban demands. With the rise of big data and machine learning, there's a significant opportunity to apply predictive analytics to improve urban mobility. This project demonstrates how such approaches can support smarter planning and more adaptive transit services.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
